If you are tired of selecting Biped body parts/pivots by a pop up menu and prefer to have your selection controls directly in the viewport then this tool may help you!

Bip-Animator is a helper tool for Biped animators that enables quick selection of Biped parts via flexible helpers. The helpers are completely non-destructive to any existing biped rig. 
They are meant to work on top of any existing workflow or setup.


# - Features:

- 1 - Easy TCB Keying with shortcut values in both Additive and override modes.

- 2 - Helper creation and setup.

- 3 - Helpers are non-destructive to any existing Biped Rig, animation or setup making them very flexible to work with.

- 4 - Foot side roll pivots auto sets sliding keys saving you the extra manual labor. 

- 5 - Helpers are also assigned on certain pivots of the biped body to avoid using the pop up menus in selecting them.

- 6 - you can delete, re-arrange and even replace helpers by your custom made ones at any time during animation.

- 7 - Key baking sliding/free on selected biped parts. (useful for Mocap clean up and quick foot sliding and animation fixes).



> [!NOTE]
Current version limitations:

- 1 - The helpers are assigned to the COM and Feet only, Hands are not yet included (may include hand pivots if there is a demand for it or in the future).

- 2 - Make sure the feet have at least one key assigned to them otherwise during helper selection you may get a pop up warning (you may ignore the warning and continue).

- 3 - Not recommended to select more than one helper at a time.
